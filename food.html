        <img src="images/asado.jpg" alt="asado">
        <div class="desc">
          <p>Don’t leave Argentina without spending a leisurely afternoon beside the warmth of a grill or open fire, feasting on copious grilled meats. Asado is both a gathering around a barbecue with friends and a method of grilling; a multi-step affair that often lasts several hours. Expect to find beef, pork, ribs, sausages, blood sausages, and sweetbreads hot off the fire. This is Argentina’s traditional food. In Patagonia, look out for a whole lamb or pig roasting over an open flame.</p>

          <p>Alfajores are crumbly shortbread-like sandwich cookies filled with jam, mousse, or dulce de leche.

          <p>The carbonada is another famous Argentine food. This is a stew made from lots of vegetables, including potatoes and sweet potatoes, sweetcorn, carrots, peppers, as well as bacon or other meat, topped with fruits ranging from dried apricots and raisins to peaches, pears, and green grapes. It is hearty and appetizing and is usually served in a pumpkin that has been hollowed out and baked. This pumpkin not only serves as a bowl but diners can scrape the inside to enrich the stew.</p>

        <h1>PIZZA AND FAINA</h1>
        <img src="images/pizza and faina.jpg" alt="pizza and faina">
        <div class="desc">
          <p>Argentinians love pizza, which they make with a thick crust, light sauce, and loads of cheese, dripping down the side of each slice. Toppings include green olives, oregano, and dried chili flakes. If you want to eat your pizza like a local, you should order a slice of fainâ to go with it. Fainâ is a crunchy, thin flatbread and it’s made from chickpea flour. Served in slices, it is placed atop the pizza to form a crunchy top layer, which serves to absorb the fat drippings from the extra cheese.</p>

        <h1>PROVOLETA</h1>
        <img src="images/provoleta.jpg" alt="provoleta">
        <div class="desc">
          <p>Grilled provoleta cheese is popular before a meal or as a side to barbecued meats. The semi-hard provolone is the perfect cheese for the grill because it’s compact and firm. For asado, it is sliced about an inch thick, seasoned with a generous amount of oregano, maybe a light sprinkling of dried red chili flakes, and grilled until it just starts to melt in the center. It is typically enjoyed topped with chimichurri sauce and served with crusty bread.</p>
